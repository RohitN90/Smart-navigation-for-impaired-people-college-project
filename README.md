# Smart Assistive Navigator for visually impaired Individuals

This project introduces the Smart Assistive Navigator, designed to improve mobility for physically impaired individuals. The prototype is an application that offers real-time navigation assistance through voice prompts and distance measurements. Leveraging the YOLO framework, the model is trained on a comprehensive dataset for accurate object detection and recognition across diverse environments. Utilizing TensorFlow and OpenCV, the system processes visual inputs to inform users about obstacles and guide them effectively. As a foundational step, this prototype aims to empower physically impaired individuals, fostering greater autonomy and confidence in their mobility.
Although currently a prototype, its design and operational principles set the stage for future enhancements and full-scale product development to enhance accessibility for all. Although this project is limited to prototype execution, its design and operational principles lay the groundwork for future enhancements and full-scale product development aimed at improving accessibility for all.

## Key Features of YOLO:
•	High-speed processing suitable for real-time detection.

•	Multi-scale predictions improve accuracy for small and large objects.

•	Single-shot detection reduces computational complexity.

•	High accuracy compared to earlier YOLO versions

## Project Scope
The scope of this project encompasses the following areas:

• The system provides real-time obstacle detection using image processing techniques.

•	It offers voice-based alerts to guide visually impaired users during navigation.

•	Designed for both indoor and outdoor use, depending on lighting and surroundings.

•	Focuses on short-range obstacle detection using a camera and basic hardware.

•	Can be implemented using cost-effective components to ensure affordability.

•	The project scope is limited to detecting static and moderately moving obstacles (e.g., walls, people, vehicles).

•	Current implementation does not include GPS or long-range navigation but can be extended in the future.

•	The solution aims to be lightweight, portable, and user-friendly for daily use.
